# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card

### ðŸ§  What I've learned from this project:

- Utilizing Figma to align design details more closely with code.

- When you set align-items: flex-start on a flex container (in this case, .card-info), it aligns all flex items along the cross axis (which is horizontal when flex-direction: column) to the start of the container â€” instead of stretching them to fill the containerâ€™s width. The same can be said if I set the align-items to center.
